## OpenGL Aimbot / Wallhack for Wolfenstein ET: Legacy

Main aimbot code is in [hack.h](./wolf-bot-dll/hack.h)

Reusable things such as the dll injector and socket client / server used to talk to the injected dll are in [common](./wolf-bot-common/)

Compiled detours library dependency is provided. Use at your own risk.

Code has been thrown together quickly, do not judge :)

Enjoy
